The **limiting-factor** crate offers facilities to implement a REST API.

The goal of this library is to provide:

  - glue code for Rocket and Diesel
  - standard API replies
  - boilerplate to parse environment and run a server

That allows an API or a back-end web server to focus on requests and data model, and to maintain helper methods as a separate library.
